## Policy Engine Issues

### Problem: Policies Not Loading
**Symptoms:**
- OPA returns empty policy set
- No policy violations detected despite obvious issues
- "No policies loaded" error messages

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check OPA status
opa eval "data"

# Verify policy directory structure
find policies/ -name "*.rego" -exec echo "Policy: {}" \; -exec head -5 {} \;

# Test policy loading explicitly
opa eval -d policies/ "data.gdpr"

# Check for syntax errors
opa fmt --diff policies/
opa test policies/
```

### Problem: Policy Evaluation Returns Unexpected Results
**Symptoms:**
- Policies allow violations that should be denied
- False positives blocking valid changes
- Inconsistent evaluation results

**Solution:**
Debug with detailed explain output and validate input format.

### Problem: Slow Policy Evaluation
**Symptoms:**
- CI/CD pipelines timing out
- High CPU usage during policy evaluation
- Evaluation times > 10 seconds

**Solution:**
Profile policy performance and optimize complex rule structures.

## CI/CD Integration Problems

### Problem: GitHub Actions Failing on Policy Checks
Add comprehensive debugging to workflow files.

### Problem: False Positives in Security Scans
Create environment-specific policy configurations.

### Problem: Terraform Integration Not Working
Verify Terraform version compatibility and JSON output format.

## Governance Workflow Issues

### Problem: Exception Requests Not Being Processed
Debug notification systems and reviewer assignments.

### Problem: Ethics Board Decisions Taking Too Long
Optimize board configuration and escalation processes.

### Problem: Risk Assessment Inconsistencies
Implement standardized risk assessment rubrics.

## Performance Problems

### Problem: High Memory Usage
Optimize OPA deployment resources and policy complexity.

### Problem: Database Performance Issues
Add proper indexing and query optimization.

### Problem: API Response Times Slow
Implement response caching and connection pooling.

# Create a FAQ document
faq = """# DDP Framework Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Dynamic Digital Privacy Framework?
The DDP Framework is an adaptive governance model for privacy compliance that integrates DevSecOps principles to embed privacy controls directly into the technology development lifecycle.

### How does DDP differ from traditional privacy approaches?
Unlike static regulatory compliance approaches, DDP provides continuous adaptation, automated validation, proactive threat modeling, and integrated ethical oversight.

### What regulations does DDP support?
DDP currently supports GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and can be extended to support other privacy regulations through Policy-as-Code implementations.

## Technical Questions

### What are the system requirements?
- Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes recommended)
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy evaluation
- Infrastructure-as-Code tools (Terraform, Ansible)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana)

### How do I write Policy-as-Code rules?
Policies are written in Rego language for Open Policy Agent. See our [Policy-as-Code Guide](policy-as-code.md) for examples and best practices.

### Can DDP integrate with existing DevOps tools?
Yes, DDP is designed to integrate with popular DevOps tools through standard APIs and webhook integrations.

## Implementation Questions

### How long does implementation take?
Typical implementation takes 16-20 weeks depending on organizational size and complexity. See our [Implementation Guide](implementation-guide.md) for detailed timelines.

### What skills are required for implementation?
Teams need expertise in DevOps/DevSecOps, privacy law, policy writing, and system architecture. Training materials are provided.

### Can we implement DDP incrementally?
Yes, DDP supports phased rollout starting with core modules and expanding coverage over time.

## Governance Questions

### How does the three-tier governance model work?
- Tier 1: Automated compliance for routine decisions
- Tier 2: Managed exceptions with human review
- Tier 3: Ethical deliberation for novel issues

### What is the Ethical Oversight Board?
An independent board combining internal experts and external members to provide ethical guidance on complex privacy decisions.

### How are exceptions handled?
Exception requests are automatically routed based on risk level, with appropriate review processes and time-bound approvals.

## Compliance Questions

### Does DDP ensure regulatory compliance?
DDP provides tools and processes to support compliance but doesn't guarantee it. Organizations must ensure proper implementation and ongoing governance.

### How does DDP handle data subject requests?
DDP automates common data subject requests like erasure and portability through Policy-as-Code enforcement and audit trails.

### What about international data transfers?
DDP policies can enforce data residency requirements and transfer restrictions based on applicable regulations.

## Support Questions

### What support is available?
- Community support through GitHub discussions
- Documentation and tutorials
- Professional services for enterprise customers
- Training and certification programs

### How do I report bugs or request features?
