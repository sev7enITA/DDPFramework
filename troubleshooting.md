## Policy Engine Issues

### Problem: Policies Not Loading
**Symptoms:**
- OPA returns empty policy set
- No policy violations detected despite obvious issues
- "No policies loaded" error messages

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check OPA status
opa eval "data"

# Verify policy directory structure
find policies/ -name "*.rego" -exec echo "Policy: {}" \; -exec head -5 {} \;

# Test policy loading explicitly
opa eval -d policies/ "data.gdpr"

# Check for syntax errors
opa fmt --diff policies/
opa test policies/
```

### Problem: Policy Evaluation Returns Unexpected Results
**Symptoms:**
- Policies allow violations that should be denied
- False positives blocking valid changes
- Inconsistent evaluation results

**Solution:**
Debug with detailed explain output and validate input format.

### Problem: Slow Policy Evaluation
**Symptoms:**
- CI/CD pipelines timing out
- High CPU usage during policy evaluation
- Evaluation times > 10 seconds

**Solution:**
Profile policy performance and optimize complex rule structures.

## CI/CD Integration Problems

### Problem: GitHub Actions Failing on Policy Checks
Add comprehensive debugging to workflow files.

### Problem: False Positives in Security Scans
Create environment-specific policy configurations.

### Problem: Terraform Integration Not Working
Verify Terraform version compatibility and JSON output format.

## Governance Workflow Issues

### Problem: Exception Requests Not Being Processed
Debug notification systems and reviewer assignments.

### Problem: Ethics Board Decisions Taking Too Long
Optimize board configuration and escalation processes.

### Problem: Risk Assessment Inconsistencies
Implement standardized risk assessment rubrics.

## Performance Problems

### Problem: High Memory Usage
Optimize OPA deployment resources and policy complexity.

### Problem: Database Performance Issues
Add proper indexing and query optimization.

### Problem: API Response Times Slow
Implement response caching and connection pooling.
